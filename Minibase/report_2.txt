Report for project 2.


Overall Status:  
	This implementation of BufMgr is 100% complete and passes all the tests from the BMTest  test driver as required.  
	We started off the project by spending some time becoming familiar with GitHUb , so that we could use it as a 
	version control system for the project.   During implementation, the first components that we found that we needed 
	were the FrameDesc class and the pickVictim method of the Clock (Replacer) class.   This enabled us to then focus 
	our attention on the implementations of the pinPage and unpinPage methods of BufMgr.   As these methods matured, 
	we then started to focus on the remaining supporting methods in the BufMgr class that we needed.   We spent some 
	time fixing some general issues and eventually were able to pass all tests successfully.   One of the last things 
	we did, was to go back in and revisit/refine the way that we were using the HashMap so that we could improve/optimize 
	the overall performance.


File Descriptions:  

  The following is the file and description of each function that we had to create or update. 

    HeapFile.java -
        The HeapFile is the main class used and implemented in project 2. The constructor of the HeapFile is used
        to initialize the heap with a given name. ...

        
    	deleteFile: This function ... 
    	
        insertRecord: This function ...

    	selectRecord: This function ... 
    	
    	updateRecord: This function ...
    	
    	deleteRecord: This function ...
    	
    	getRecCnt: This function updates the specified record in the heap file.
    	
    	openScan: This function initiates a sequential scan of the heap file.
    	
    	toString: This function returns the name of the heap file.

Division of Labor:
   
    We began by having everyone read the chapter and get themselves familiar with how the heap should work.
    We would meet briefly after class to go over what has been completed and what still needs to be implemented.
    
    The BufMgr class was implemented by Bill Annocki, Mike Norris, & Sean Fast (45 hours). The Clock and FrameDesc classes were 
    implemented by Dave Gwalthney and Dave Shanline (30 hours). The integration with Github and Eclipse was set up by Dave Gwalthney & 
    Dave Shanline.
    
Notes:

   Bug found in buffer manager: We didn't reset the dirty bit after flushing the page.
