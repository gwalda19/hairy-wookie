Report for project 2.


Overall Status:  
	This implementation of BufMgr is 100% complete and passes all the tests from the BMTest  test driver as required.  
	We started off the project by spending some time becoming familiar with GitHUb , so that we could use it as a 
	version control system for the project.   During implementation, the first components that we found that we needed 
	were the FrameDesc class and the pickVictim method of the Clock (Replacer) class.   This enabled us to then focus 
	our attention on the implementations of the pinPage and unpinPage methods of BufMgr.   As these methods matured, 
	we then started to focus on the remaining supporting methods in the BufMgr class that we needed.   We spent some 
	time fixing some general issues and eventually were able to pass all tests successfully.   One of the last things 
	we did, was to go back in and revisit/refine the way that we were using the HashMap so that we could improve/optimize 
	the overall performance.


File Descriptions:  

  The following is a list and description of each file that we had to create or update. 

    Clock.java - The Clock.java class extends the abstract class Replacer, and will be used as the replacement policy
                 by the buffer manager class. We override the pickVictim() method in this class with the implementation
                 of the clock replacement policy. In the pickVictim() method, we iterate through the frames in the array
                 of frame descriptions looking for an available frame to store the current page.  First we check if the
                 frame contains any valid data. If the frame is empty then we can store data to that frame, so we select
                 it. If the frame contains valid data, we then check the frames pin count. If the pin count is greater
                 than 0, then the frame is not a candidate for replacement so we increment the counter in order to check
                 the next frame. If the pin count is 0, we then consider its reference bit which indicates how recently
                 the frame was used. If the current frame has the reference bit turned on, then the algorithm turns it
                 off and increments the counter to the next frame. If the frames pin count is 0 and the reference bit is
                 off, then we have found an unpinned frame that has not been used recently, so we chose it and return
                 its location (counter).
    
    FrameDesc.java -
    	This is a class that is setup to be a data structure to hold the frame descriptions. This class has all
    	protected member variables so that they can be used by elements residing in its own class or classes in
    	the same package.

    	Dirty is a boolean that lets the frame buffer now if the frame is dirty.
    	Pin_count contains the count of how many callers have pins on the frame.
    	Valid is a boolean that lets the frame buffer know if the frame contains valid data.
    	Refbit is used to help with choosing the next victim of the clock replacement policy.
    	Pageno is the disk page number of the data.
    
    BufMgr.java - 
    	The BufMgr is the main class used and implemented in project 1.  The constructor of the BufMgr is used 
    	to initialize the buffer pool as an array of Page objects. Each object is called a Frame.  As a parameter 
    	the BufMgr constructor takes in the number of frames that will be in the buffer pool.  The constructor 
    	also creates two hashmaps: one that maps pages to frames and the other that maps frames to pages.  
    	Instead of having to search thru the hashmap looking for the page that the frame mapped to 
    	previously (and removing it) every single time we add a new mapping, we are keep two hashmaps to do 
    	this much more efficiently.  The BufMgr determines, very efficiently, what frame a given disk page occupies.
    	
    	pinPage: This function increments the pin count of a page in the buffer pool. If the page is not yet in
    	the buffer pool, then it uses the replacement policy (the pickVictim method of the clock class in this case) 
    	to select a frame to replace and adds the disk page to that frame and then pins it. It will also write the 
    	replaced victim page in the frame to disk if the page residing in it was marked "dirty". If all pages in the 
    	buffer pool are currently pinned then none can be replaced and an exception is thrown. 
    	
        addToHashMap: This function is used to add entries to the two hashmaps.  See the notes at the end of this
        report for a detailed explanation of the double hashmap implementation.

    	unpinPage: This function takes a frame in the buffer pool and decrements its pin count, while marking its
    	dirty bit to the boolean value passed in as a parameter. If the pin count was already at zero when the function
    	attempts to unpin it further, we throw an exception. An exception is also thrown if the page requested to be
    	unpinned is not in the buffer pool to begin with. 
    	
    	newPage(): The function newPage() allocates a run of new disk pages and pins the first one in the buffer pool. 
    	This method first checks the number of unpinned pages to ensure there are available slots in the buffer pool.  
    	This method then allocates the number of disk pages passed in as a parameter. The BufMgr checks if the first page 
    	is already mapped into the buffer pool and pinned. If not, it pins the first page and returns its page ID.
    	
    	freePage(): The method freePage() deallocates a single page from disk and freeing it from the buffer pool if needed.  
    	This function takes in a PageId object as parameter to identify the exact page to free from the buffer pool.  
    	The page ID is used to access the frame number and check if the page is already pinned. If the page is currently 
    	pinned then the page cannot be freed from the buffer pool.
    	
    	flushAllPage(): The method flushAllPages() writes all the valid and dirty frames to disk. This function is similar 
    	to flushPage() except for this method writes all pages to the disk.  The function loops through and finds all the 
    	valid pages that have their dirty bit set and flushes those pages.
    	
    	flushPage(): The method flushPage() writes a page in the buffer pool to disk if that page is dirty. This function 
    	takes in a PageId object as parameter to identify the exact page to flush from the buffer manager. This function 
    	uses the page number to access the frame number and then writes that page to disk.
    	
    	getNumBuffers(): The method getNumBuffers() get the total number of buffer frames. This function returns the number 
    	of frames in the buffer pool.
    	
    	getNumUnpinned(): The method getNumUnpinned() gets the total number of unpinned buffer frames in the BufMgr.  
    	To determine the number of unpinned buffer frames, the BufMgr loops through the entire frame table and counts 
    	all the empty unpinned buffer frames.

Division of Labor:
   
    We began by having everyone read the chapter and get themselves familiar with how the buffer manager should work.
    We also had to read up on how the clock replacement policy should get implemented. We would meet briefly after class
    to go over what has been completed and what still needs to be implemented. 
    
    The BufMgr class was implemented by Bill Annocki, Mike Norris, & Sean Fast (45 hours). The Clock and FrameDesc classes were 
    implemented by Dave Gwalthney and Dave Shanline (30 hours). The integration with Github and Eclipse was set up by Dave Gwalthney & 
    Dave Shanline.
    
Notes:

   Bug found in buffer manager not resetting the dirty bit....
